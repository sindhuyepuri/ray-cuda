2. After running the raycheck.py code, we seemed to get a bit of warnings on almost all of the tests. After looking at the diff, we saw some odd pics (very blue and pretty), but we never ran into any such color issues when testing in the GUI/Commandline. Dr. Vouga said the error might be randomness in unintialized memory, however the blue-ish pretty pictures only appeared in raycheck.py and the same color issue is present consistently in all the renders in raycheck. I also think that we didn't handle colored light as correctly as we should've. In the render with the cylinder and magenta light, we get the correct specular spot, but I think in the turtle render, there should be some additional color contribution. We attempted threading, but were unable to get std::thread to compile on our machines, so we would've liked to see more speedup.
